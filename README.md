# Terminal Sorting Visualizer

A for fun project made for visualizing a variety of algorithms. The visualizer consists of self made prints that simulate bars moving around. Every time you run the program it generates a random array that is later sorted. The length of the array depends on the terminal size.

Every single algorithm has been modified by me to be the most "pythonic". That means that there's some "clever code" that I might not be able to debug in the future. I know this is a bad practice, but I felt like copy and pasting the algorithms was cheating.

The current available algorithms are: selection, insertion, merge, quick, heap, counting, radix and bucket, along to special algorithms, stalin and bongo sorts.

In order to visualize algorithms such as bucket I've had to take some poetic license.
